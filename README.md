# data-compression
This project is an implementation of the LZW compression algorithm with BWT encoding that was completed as a final project for one of my algorithms classes. My algorithm placed in the top 10 for best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression_ratio">compression ratio</a> out of approximately 400 students in the class.
